        <p>
            I am currently attending Grand Valley State University and
            am pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. Prior
            to GVSU, I attended Muskegon Community College and got my
            Associates in Science and Arts degree. I accomplished this 
            through the Early College program, which means that I got my
            High School diploma at the same time that I got my Associates
            degree.
        </p>
        <p>
            Long term, I would like to earn a Master's in Business and a
            Master's in Computer Science/Mathematics. Preferably, this
            degree would incorperate both of my bachelor degrees. I would
            to earn both of these degrees within ten years of graduating
            and while working (hoping my employer would help pay for them).
            If the cards are right, I wouldn't mind going for a PhD that uses
            both of my degrees and be a professor in either Computer Science
            or Mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
            For work, I would probably prefer to stay in west Michigan and
            work in an Engineering environment. The reason would be because I
            enjoy the structure provided by the Engineering world. To prepare
            for this, I plan to take an A.I. course as I have noticed many
            manufacturing companies are looking for talent in that field.

            <p>
                The man in the picture is Mike English, my dad. He inspires me 
                as he was born into a family that didn't have much and he was
                able to get out of that situation and attended Ferris State 
                University. He graduated with a degree in Manufacturing Engineering 
                and is currently the Launch manager as Tiara Yachts (he oversees 
                the production of the newest yachts).
