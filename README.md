    <h1>CIS-371</h1>
    <p>Welcome! This repo will hold my work from CIS-371 as I complete the course during the summer semester of 2019. GVSU's CIS department will act as the host for the server location of the website. Click on <a href="https://cis.gvsu.edu/~englisni/">this</a> to see the websites rendered! Just click on &quot;CIS-371&quot; and select an assignment to view it.</p>
